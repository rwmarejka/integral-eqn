Fredholm Integral Equations of the Second Kind using Chebyshev Polynomials

A C program to solve Fredholm Integral Equations of the Second Kind using Chebyshev Polynomials
It uses the Fox & Parker (1968) approach of a Chebyshev approximation to the kernel function.

Several examples are included along with Mac OS X Grapher.app files.
